# rossuse
Generate rpm spec files for Opensuse/SLES

This is a first attempt at integrating ROS building/packaging with the Open Build Service.

The script is messy but it works. It relies on some custom modifications to rosdistro which I am
currently maintaining in 

https://github.com/neotinker/rosdistro

I will eventual try and get these changes merged into the standard ROS rosdistro repo

https://github.com/ros/rosdistro

Use it at your own risk :)
